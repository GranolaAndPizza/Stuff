Applicant tracker for applicants. 

People apply to so many jobs that sometimes
they forget:
- what job they applied to
- when they applied to that job
- what resume they used

This would be an easy way for people to 
keep track of all of that

Currently I use a combination of Gmail and 
Excel to track my applications and it can 
become messy and overwhelming.
