Applicant tracker for applicants. 

People apply to so many jobs that sometimes
they forget:
- what job they applied to
- when they applied to that job
- what resume they used

This would be an easy way for people to 
keep track of all of that

Currently I use a combination of Gmail and 
Excel to track my applications and it can 
become messy and overwhelming.

SECOND SLIDER
During the job application process, you might end up applying for dozens of jobs. 
With so many opportunities – and months of wait time to hear back about positions
 – it’s only natural to get a little confused. The worst-case scenario: 
you get a call about a position you can’t exactly remember, you panic, and then you ask, 
“Which job is this for?”

You don't wanna be THAT guy.
